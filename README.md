# rjs
Native Javascript environment using Rust and Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JS engine.

## Why?
This project would like to be:
- A way to use Javascript to make Android games, using a thin WebGL/GLES binding.
- Javascript compatible with Node.js.
- An easy to use binding for Rust projects to embed a Javascript engine.
- A superhero.

This is going to take a lot of work, and there are things for everyone to do, so 
peek into the Issues and look for a "help wanted" issue to get started!

## Why not?
- Why not use straight Rust?  
  Javascript with hot module reloading has a faster edit-compile-run cycle.
  
- Why not V8?  
  It's time for SpiderMonkey to find more uses outside of Firefox.
